abstract = {In recent years, DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) has gained significant traction as a privacy-preserving
alternative to unencrypted DNS. While several studies have measured DoH performance
relative to traditional DNS and other encrypted DNS schemes, they are often incomplete,
either conducting measurements from single countries or are unable to compare encrypted
DNS to default client behavior. To expand on existing research, we use the BrightData
proxy network to gather a dataset consisting of 22,052 unique clients across 224 countries
and territories. Our data shows that the performance impact of a switch to DoH is
mixed, with a median slowdown of 65ms per query across a 10-query connection, but
with 28% of clients receiving a speedup over that same interval. We compare four public
DoH providers, noting that Cloudflare excels in both DoH resolution time (265ms) and
global points-of-presence (146). Furthermore, we analyze geographic differences between
DoH and Do53 resolution times, and provide analysis on possible causes, finding that
clients from countries with low Internet infrastructure investment are almost twice
as likely to experience a slowdown when switching to DoH as those with high Internet
infrastructure investment. We conclude with possible improvements to the DoH ecosystem.
We hope that our findings can help to inform continuing DoH deployments.},
